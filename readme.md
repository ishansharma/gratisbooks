# Gratis Books

Gratis Books is a free platform to connect students who want to donate their text books to other students in need.

It is a free platform where students can register and list their text books. Students/NGOs in need can claim these books.

## Roadmap

The project is in its initial phase for now and basic functionality is being built. Ideally, here's what we should have in v1:

1. Ability for students to register **Discuss**: What data do we need? Email ID and password only? Anything else? 
2. Ability to enter list of their textbooks. **Discuss**: What fields do we need here? Book name, publisher, standard, condition, education board...
3. Ability to see the list of textbooks and filter according to class, subject, education board, area(?)
4. Ability to request the book. **Discuss**: Need to decide how the claims will be handled. Between someone requesting a book and its assignment by admin/editor, can others request it?

## Moving Ahead

Initial idea is to keep everything simple and not custom code anything to quickly get the platform up. We plan to use [CRUD toolset](https://wp-types.com) for this.
